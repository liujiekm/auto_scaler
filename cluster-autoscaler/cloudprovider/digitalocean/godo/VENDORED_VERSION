The `godo` package was vendored based on the git SHA `1f632d37f6858f0532207a5f77118c097d94be89`.

* We removed the `util/` folder because it's not needed.
* We removed the `go.mod` to avoid conflicts (https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/commit/a96bd9adc3d041cb2328b88101d995546e360d15#diff-d5d7c905baa3f3ba3fd4563b8b5ff9fa).
* We vendored the dependencies by calling `go mod vendor` after checking out a new version.

To upgrade to a new `godo` version do the following:

```sh
cd cloudprovider/digitalocean

# Remove the godo folder
rm -rf godo/

# Clone the godo folder
git clone https://github.com/digitalocean/godo
cd godo

# Checkout to new release, replace the version. Here we're using v1.22.0
git checkout v1.22.0

# Vendor all dependencies
go mod vendor

# Remove the .git and util/
rm -rf .git util/ go.mod

# Re-add this VENDORED_VERSION file and edit to indicate which version is now being used.
```
